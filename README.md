# HugYouColors

HugYouColors allow you to choose a secondary character that is aiding you through your game.
Cards of their color can show up in card rewards and shop, you can find their character-specific relic, and you can give them a hand in a special event.
If you choose two basegame characters, there are 15 additional cards for each pair of characters - a total of 90 new cards.
